# 🗒 What the Fork? (Contributing Guidelines)

> A simple guide on how to contribute to this project, from start to end! Also did you get the pun? I love The Good Place.

Is this your first time contributing to open source? No worries, here's a simple guide to help you out! If you get stuck on a step, please don't hesitate to ask me. :)

You can contribute in two ways, whichever is more convinient for you:
1. Via Github Website _(no need to download anything!)_
2. Via Local Machine

## 1️⃣ Via Github Website
1. Check the **Issues page** to choose what you want to contribute on!

2. Click on **Fork** on the upper right hand of the screen.

> ☁️ Forking a Repository allows you to have your own copy of the repository. This is the best practice for contributing to open source projects.

3. Once the repo is forked, you'll be redirected to the newly created repository. You should see **forked from jayehernandez / letra-extension**.

4. You can now make changes to this repository, depending on what issues you chose to take on. 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻

5. When you're finished with the changes, you'll see that your repository is ahead of some commits from the main repository. Click on **Pull Request** to start creating a pull request (PR).

> ☁️ Pull Requests allow maintainers of a project to review your code and merge it to the main repository afterwards.

6. You'll be able to choose which branch you'd like to compare with. Make sure you choose the **master** branch. After this, you can click on **Create pull request**.

7. You'll be able to edit the title and description of your pull request before actually creating the pull request. If you are referencing an open issue, please reference it here. 

> ☁️ Reference an issue: Typing out the pound sign (#) will search through issues and PRs in the repository. You can write something like: "This PR references #14" and it will automatically be linked to issue number 14!
